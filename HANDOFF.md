# ClipCourt — Handoff Notes (Pre-Restart)

> Written by Jean East 🧭 before machine restart for macOS update + Xcode install.

## Project Status: Code Complete, Awaiting Build

### What's Done ✅
| Phase | Owner | Status | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| Product Spec | — | ✅ Complete | `Spec.md` — includes pinch-to-zoom timeline and landscape-first requirements |
| UI/UX Design | Designer Ralph | ✅ Complete | `Design.md` — full design system, colors, dimensions, animations, haptics, accessibility |
| Architecture | Architect Ralph | ✅ Complete | `Architecture.md` — MVVM, service layer, data models, export pipeline design |
| Source Scaffold | Architect Ralph | ✅ Complete | 18 Swift files, proper directory structure |
| SwiftUI Views | FE Ralph | ✅ Complete | PlayerView, SegmentTimelineView, ExportView, ImportView, Color+ClipCourt, HapticManager |
| Video Infrastructure | Video Infra Ralph | ✅ Complete | AVFoundation playback, segment management, lossless + lossy export, persistence |
| Xcode Project | PM Ralph | ✅ Generated | `project.yml` + `.xcodeproj` via xcodegen |
| PM Code Review | PM Ralph | 🔨 In Progress | Was running when machine shutdown requested |
| QA Testing | QA Ralph | 🕐 Not Started | Blocked on Xcode install |

### What's Needed Next 🔲
1. **Install Xcode** from App Store (requires macOS update first)
2. **After Xcode install**, run:
   ```bash
   sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
   xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch
   ```
3. **Install iOS Simulator** (Xcode will prompt, or: `xcodebuild -downloadPlatform iOS`)
4. **Regenerate Xcode project** (in case xcodegen updated):
   ```bash
   cd ~/Documents/projects/ClipCourt
   xcodegen generate
   ```
5. **Build**:
   ```bash
   xcodebuild -project ClipCourt.xcodeproj -scheme ClipCourt -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' build
   ```
6. **Deploy QA Ralph** to test on simulator
7. **PM Ralph** should finish code review and fix any integration issues

### GitHub
- **Repo:** https://github.com/jean-east/ClipCourt
- **Branch:** `main`
- **All code pushed** as of shutdown

### Known Issues / Watch For
- PM Ralph's code review may have found integration issues — check for `STATUS.md` after restart
- SegmentTimelineView.swift is only 70 lines — pinch-to-zoom may not have been fully implemented by FE Ralph
- The Xcode project was generated by xcodegen — may need regeneration if files were added/moved during PM review
- No HapticManager.swift file exists yet (was in FE Ralph's task list) — may be inline in views or missing
- Engineers worked in parallel and may have conflicting changes to shared files (Models, Services)

### Git Watcher
The auto-commit background script has been **killed**. After restart, re-enable if needed:
```bash
bash ~/Documents/projects/ClipCourt/.git-watcher.sh &
```

### Resume Plan
1. Finish macOS update + install Xcode
2. Re-launch the git watcher
3. Have PM Ralph finish review (or do it fresh)
4. Build the project — fix any compiler errors
5. Deploy QA Ralph on simulator
6. Iterate on bugs until clean
